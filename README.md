# Android_App_Java - (Android Studio)
## This project has three objectives: 
* to interact with the UI through Java
* to use both implicit and explicit Intents
*  to use an Adapter to populate a ListView
## Design specs: 
“The University of Waikato saw your landing page for SCMS and now they want
you to create an Android app for them. They have asked you to develop an application that
provides information on three faculties and two facilities that are provided on campus: the
School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, the
Faculty of Law, the University Library, and the shops and lakes. 
#### The project must contain
+ a list of the faculties and facilities available
+ a detail page for each
+  the ability to
‘share’ information about them.”
## The app contains:
* Three Java Activities: MainActivity.java, ListActivity.java, and DetailActivity.java
* The related XML layout files: activity_main.xml, activity_list.xml, and activity_detail.xml
* Five images: img_scms, img_fass, img_law, img_library, and img_lakes
* A strings.xml file with the required strings
* A colors.xml file with the required colours
* And an arrays.xml file with all of the dummy data for the five faculties and facilities
## Steps:
* onclick and explicit Intents
* Using an array Adapter
*  Updating the UI using Java
*   Implicit Intents – “sharing”
